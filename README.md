# Image-Steganography

I have used 2 files here: main.py and ciphertext.py. 
ciphertext.py - converts the message to cipher text and vice versa (this is added for more security)
main.py - here all the encoding and decoding of the ciphertext into the image happens here
**Note - I did this code in google colab, so some modules didn't work there, so I had to use a different modified version
